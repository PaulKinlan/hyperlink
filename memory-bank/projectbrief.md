## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a collection of browser extensions that experiment with AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the user's browsing experience.

## Core Requirements

- Each experiment should be a self-contained browser extension.
- Experiments should be developed in TypeScript.
- A shared library should be used for common functionality.
- The project should be structured as a monorepo.

## Scope

The initial scope of the project is to develop three extensions:

- `summary`: An extension to summarize the current page.
- `tab-group-summary`: An extension to summarize all tabs in a group.
- `merge`: An extension to merge the content of a linked page with the current page.
