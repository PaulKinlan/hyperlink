# Product Context

This document describes the "why" behind the project. It outlines the problems the project solves, how it should work from a user's perspective, and the overall user experience goals.

## Problem Statement

Users are often overwhelmed with the amount of information available on the web. It can be time-consuming to read through long articles, and difficult to keep track of multiple tabs. This project aims to solve these problems by providing tools to summarize content and manage tabs more effectively.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this project is anyone who uses the web for research, learning, or work. This includes students, researchers, developers, and knowledge workers.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to quickly summarize the content of a web page so that I can understand the key points without having to read the entire article.
- As a user, I want to be able to summarize all the tabs in a group so that I can get an overview of the content without having to switch between tabs.
- As a user, I want to be able to merge the content of a linked page with the current page so that I can read the content in one place without having to navigate to a new page.
