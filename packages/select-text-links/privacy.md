# Privacy Policy for Select Text Open Hyperlinks

**Last updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Select Text Open Hyperlinks is a Chrome extension that allows you to open all hyperlinks within selected text in new tabs. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** This extension:

- Does not collect personal information
- Does not track your browsing activity
- Does not send any data to external servers
- Does not store any data locally or remotely
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely locally within your browser:

1. When you select text on a webpage and right-click, a context menu option appears
2. The extension extracts hyperlinks from your selected text
3. Those links are opened in new tabs in your browser

All processing happens locally in your browser. No information ever leaves your device.

## Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions to function:

- **contextMenus**: To add a right-click menu option
- **tabs**: To open links in new tabs
- **scripting**: To read links from selected text on the page
- **host_permissions (all URLs)**: To work on any webpage you visit

These permissions are used solely for the extension's functionality and not for data collection.
