# Blockquote

This browser extension finds all blockquotes on a page that have a `cite` attribute, and then fetches the content from the URL in the `cite` attribute and replaces the content of the blockquote with the content of the page.

This is useful for keeping blockquotes up-to-date with the latest content from the source.
