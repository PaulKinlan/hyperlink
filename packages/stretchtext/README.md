# Stretchtext

This browser extension implements some of Ted Nelson's ideas on Stretchtext.

Stretchtext is a concept where a user can expand or contract a document to reveal more or less detail. This extension allows you to click on certain elements to expand them and see more information, or contract them to hide it.
