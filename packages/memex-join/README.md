# Memex Trail Join

This browser extension allows you to create links between content on any web page and any other and have them persist.

This is inspired by Vannevar Bush's Memex concept, allowing users to create their own trails of associated content across the web.

TODO: For really common words, we should find the parent node, or try and use a more specific text fragment to avoid creating links in the middle of words or other unintended places.
