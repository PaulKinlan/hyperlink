# Backlinks Extension

This extension helps you build a graph of your browsing history by tracking backlinks and navigation paths.

## How it works

When you visit a page, the extension finds all the links on the page and stores them in a local database. The current page is then added to a list of inbound links to that discovered page.

When you navigate to a page, the extension stores that the navigation happened. This allows you to see the web you navigated versus the one you didn't.

## How to use

There are two ways to see the backlinks for a page:

1.  **Right-click on a page:** Right-click anywhere on a page and select "Show Backlinks for this page" from the context menu. This will open a new tab with a list of all the pages that link to the current page.
2.  **Right-click on a link:** Right-click on any link and select "Show Backlinks for this link" from the context menu. This will open a new tab with a list of all the pages that link to the linked page.
